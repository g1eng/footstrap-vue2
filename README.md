# FootStrap Vue

## About

FootStrap is yet another Twitter's bootstrap wrapper for Vue.js.
Maybe, Nuxt.js community seems not to make any positive action for the next release of bootstrap-vue, which supports Vue3 or Bootstrap 5.x.

I need bootstrap and Vue.js, at least one or more years at now (July 2021) and made this repo as a personal bootstrap-vue alternative.
This project is for all who shares such conditions.

This project is not a fork or a copy of bootstrap-vue and it will not be a complete alternative with full-features of bootstrap-vue.

## Demo

Make first demo with these commands:

```
yarn install
yarn serve
```

## supported Platform

* Bootstrap 5.x
* Vue2 

In this project, bootstrap 4.x is not supported. 
Now working with vue3 for internal use case.

## Practical Usage

Point git submodule to this repo for your project's /component/submodule.
Then, import components for each.

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
